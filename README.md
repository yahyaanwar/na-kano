**Stateful Todo App**. Initially, this is a project built for my purpose.
The main goal is to create a to-do app that can reset in a specific moment.

This app builds with svelte and synchronized to firebase with svelte-fire. The last change of your filters will be saved automatically. So, your shown todo will be stateful.
Feel free to fork and modify your version. Submit your pull request or issue, I will review it asap.
